# Auto Completion

Inspired by VSCode auto completion, this web browser extension predicts your word and give you suggestions as you type.

it's still under development, currently in version 0.0

you can try it from here: 
* chrome: # todo: put a link here once I publish it
* firefox: [addons mozilla](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/auto-completion/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search)
